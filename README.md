# Infinite search for infinite scroll (but not only).

Ever found yourself clicking pressing enter every time you scrolled?
Ever found yourself expanding more and more log windows only to click search again and again?

Well you don't have to do this anymore with Infinite Search!


## Ways to use: 

* click the omnibar (url bar) or press F6, and then type "sc"
  then type whatever you want to search for
* click the extension and enter your search, it will start searching as you type
  it's possible to use regex and have case insenstivity
* TBD: press ctrl+shift+f and the search window will open


#### TODO:
* Have the input in focus when the popup shows up
* maybe add flashing to words that come into view as you scroll
* make ctrl+shift+f work
